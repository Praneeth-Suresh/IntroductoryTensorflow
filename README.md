# IntroductoryTensorflow
 Here is a summary of the basic operations that need to be mastered to effectively use Tensorflow.

The file `Tensorflow.ipynb` is the flow of concepts that I followed while learning TensorFlow 2.x. It will give you a good understanding of the underlying design philosophies of the ML platform.

The file `Implementing_machine_learning.ipynb` are some machine learning projects built with TensorFlow. They are mostly different approaches to building a classfication algorithm for the MNIST dataset.
